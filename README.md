# Project 2


#What is the theme youâ€™ll be using for project 2?

The theme of my project is to take you back to the simpler days of Myspace. 

#How did you incorporate your theme within your project?

I incorporated my theme by adding the myspace logo as my background to the 
chat. I also made good 'ol Tom as my chatbot. 

#What are known problems, if any, with your project?

Sometimes when using the Yoda API it will timeout and throw an error. 


#How would you improve it if you had more time?

It hardly comes up, but I would maybe try and catch the error so it doesn't mess
up the chatroom. If it comes up in testing (which happened to me) just rebuild it
again and it should pass the next time. 

#Improvements

I fixed the bug that whenever you would sign out of facebook and then sign into google, it 
would post an error.
