# Project 2


#What is the theme youâ€™ll be using for project 2?

The theme of my project is to take you back to the simpler days of Myspace. 

#How did you incorporate your theme within your project?

I incorporated my theme by adding the myspace logo as my background to the 
chat. I also made good 'ol Tom as my chatbot. 

#What are known problems, if any, with your project?

The only problems that I have is with the user count. When refreshing it will just
keep adding more users because it takes a while to pick up on who disconnects. Also
the user list is broken and it will add the same user more than once sometimes, and 
sometimes it wont remove them from the list. 


#How would you improve it if you had more time?

I would fix the part that shows the amount of users by using socket methods of tracking
the amount of users that are connected. Also to fix the user list, if I could get the IDs
of all the users that are connected I would be able to remove users who aren't connected
based on their ids from the list.
